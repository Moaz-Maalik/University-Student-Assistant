# University-Student-Assistant
A Web-Application written in Spring-Boot

Application Name: USA (University Student Assistant)

This app will assist the students in FAST by providing them useful utility features. Some Important features include Timetable Manager, Swapper Finder, and Chill Spot Finder. Our app would also hold login credentials for all the students and use the latest timetable provided by the University to keep up-to-date and meaningful information.

Our appâ€™s user base consists entirely of University Student, and in the current case, it encompasses only FAST. Age demographic ranges from 18-24 year olds (optimally) and all our users are literate and modern. The app usage would be based on need, as it does not have any continuous interactive sessions.

Our first two features solve the problem of a few registration issues and Chill Spot Finder is a really handy feature. Our app ensures full automation of mundane tasks that students had to perform, enabling students to focus more on useful tasks.
